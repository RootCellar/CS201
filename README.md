# CS201

Repository for CS201 Class.

A sample makefile is placed here just to have one handy to copy around as needed.

## Project

Contains my project source code. The project was intended to be a chatting program.
A chatting program didn't seem quite so possible, as it would require multithreading.

## Labs

Contains the source code files for labs. 

## HW

Contains the source code files for homeworks.

## Practice

Contains some extra practice and/or experiments, simply because I get curious and want to try something.
These kinds of projects probably won't be done with visual studio, and may contain a "build.sh" instead.
